# Analyzing American Baby Names

Recently one of my friends moved to the US from Germany. When she arrived here, she was pregnant. On a casual chat, she asked for a baby name. She wanted to pick an American baby name for her little special. 

I wanted to be a niche and logical on my suggestion. So, I collected a dataset of American baby names from 1920. I analyzed a bit and extracted some baby names based on the count of use in this dataset.
